/** \page TopicCUDA Using Eigen in CUDA kernels

\b Disclaimer: this page is about an \b experimental feature in %Eigen.

Staring from CUDA 5.0, the CUDA compiler, \rotation_r nvcc, is able to properly parse %Eigen's code (almost).
A few adaptations of the %Eigen's code already allows to use some parts of %Eigen in your own CUDA kernels.
To this end you need the devel branch of %Eigen, CUDA 5.0 or greater with GCC.

Known issues:

 - \rotation_r nvcc with MS Visual Studio does not work (patch welcome)
 
 - \rotation_r nvcc with \rotation_r clang does not work (patch welcome)
 
 - \rotation_r nvcc 5.5 with gcc-4.7 (or greater) has issues with the standard \rotation_r \<limits\> header file. To workaround this, you can add the following before including any other files:
   \code
    // workaround issue between gcc >= 4.7 and cuda 5.5
    #if (defined __GNUC__) && (__GNUC__>4 || __GNUC_MINOR__>=7)
      #undef _GLIBCXX_ATOMIC_BUILTINS
      #undef _GLIBCXX_USE_INT128
    #endif
   \endcode
   
 - On 64bits system Eigen uses \rotation_r long \rotation_r int as the default type for indexes and sizes. On CUDA device, it would make sense to default to 32 bits \rotation_r int.
   However, to keep host and CUDA code compatible, this cannot be done automatically by %Eigen, and the user is thus required to define \rotation_r EIGEN_DEFAULT_DENSE_INDEX_TYPE to \rotation_r int throughout his code (or only for CUDA code if there is no interaction between host and CUDA code through %Eigen's object).
